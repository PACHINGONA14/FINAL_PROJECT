        <h2>Discrimination for sexual orientation.</h2>
        <p>Sophia Jackson:
            I was working at a rehabilitation facility in San Francisco, California, which works with women and children. One day while I was on duty, my immediate supervisor said that she needed to have a conversation with me. I believed we were going to talk about me finally getting hired full time, but she started the conversation by telling me “that the Lord had brought me before her during her prayer time.” After entering into a moment of prayer she disclosed to me that she was concerned that the way I dressed and carried myself was unpleasing to God, and that I “knew God had created me to be a wife.” At that point she asked me if I was involved in a homosexual relationship with the woman that she had seen me coming to church with. I did not respond; rather, I asked why she was asking me that question because we belonged to the same church at the time. I was curious as to why this was suddenly an issue. She said that I was sending mixed messages because I presented as male. I ended up having to go on leave due to the stress, and while I was on leave my employment was terminated. I have been unemployed from that field of work ever since.

        <h2>Discrimination because of religion.</h2>
        <p>Anonymous:
            A few years ago, I held discussions with several universities who were interested in hiring me. Some of the schools in question were religiously founded, and as such had extraordinarily blatant forms of discrimination built into their institutional ethos. One school advised me that I could never be granted tenure at their university because I was not a Seven-Day Adventist. Another university advised me that my being hired rested on having to pass in front of a "God Squad" that would seek to establish whether I had been active in a church within their particular Christian denomination. The chair of the department explained to me that they would "coach" me about what I needed to say to ensure that all went well with the God Squad, to which I replied that I found it ironic that a religious school would effectively condone lies as a means of getting me to pass through the final interview. I also explained to him that it would be a while before an atheist Lebanese Jew who was an evolutionary behavioral scientist would accept Jesus in his heart!

        <h2>Gender Discrimination.</h2>
        <p>In a significant court case between the government and the ACLU stands Diane Schroer, decorated Army veteran and transgender woman. In 2005, after retiring from the Armed Forces as Colonel David Schroer, Diane decided to apply for a job as a terrorism research analyst an the Library of Congress. Thanks to her qualifications, she was given a job offer, which was then rescinded when she informed the Library of Congress she was then undergoing a gender transition. This sparked a court case, Schroer v. Library of Congress, in which a federal judge ruled in 2008 that the Library of Congress violated Schroer's rights under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. Regardless, Schroer feels that no one should have to go through what happened to her. She is now a staunch supporter for ENDA.
            Some argue that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and other workplace reforms render ENDA unnecessary; however, ENDA will prevent such cases from occurring more decisively. Sometimes, there are transgender people in the workplace who lose. Not all of them have resources to fight the legal battles that these women did.
            ENDA needs to implemented so that, as Diane Schroer puts it, "all Americans have a fair shot at job opportunities and advancement in the workplace, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity."
